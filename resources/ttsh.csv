With acute exacerbation, patients with chronic lung diseases often present with worsening symptoms such as dyspnea and increased secretion production. These symptoms, when not addressed promptly, could lead to severe respiratory failure consequently. After an acute exacerbation, patients with chronic lung diseases often continue to experience dyspnea and reduced effort tolerance, which could result in decreased quality of life and potential functional decline. Timely and appropriate medical and physiotherapy treatment is therefore imperative in the acute stage to facilitate recovery and delay functional deterioration, be it in the critical care units or general wards.<br><br>This one day workshop aims to equip physiotherapists with the understanding of respiratory impairments present in patients with chronic lung diseases.
